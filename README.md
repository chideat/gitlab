Script for install gitlab v4 on centos
========================================

just as officat instraction
https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md

but here i use apache replaced nginx, because nginx failed to work.

attention
==========
the most possible failing way is when us step up gitolite. the version must be right to gitlab. an for gitlab v5, gitolite will never be used.
